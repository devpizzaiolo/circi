p Our gluten-free pizza dough is made fresh daily, and has been called the Best Gluten-Free Pizza in Canada. Add your own gluten-free toppings to ensure you and your loved ones don’t miss out on the mouthwatering flavour of traditional Italian pizza. Your pizza can be made with Daiya cheese, a lactose and gluten-free vegetarian-based cheese, which is also free of caseine and soya. All of our Pizzaiolo locations are 100% nut free, and we do not add sugar to any of our products - we don’t even have any on the premises!
