		p Keep your eyes open for our annual donation promotion, where one dollar from every slice of pizza sold at all of our stores during lunch will go to a select charity.

		p We are proud to give to our main charity, Sick Kids, as well as provide food for many other charities and their events, including the United Way, the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the Canadian Cancer Society.

		p We contribute to various elementary, high school, and university events, including Pizza Days and special events. We have also sponsored corporate events such as TD and RBC fundraisers.

		p We have been a proud pizza sponsor of the Toronto Santa Claus parade since 2005.
