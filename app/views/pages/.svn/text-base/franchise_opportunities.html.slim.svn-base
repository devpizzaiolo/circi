p.lead Pizzaiolo Gourmet Pizza was founded in August of 1999, with our first store opening on November 13, 2000. Our business continues to grow as happy customers spread the word and keep coming back for the taste, the service, and the quality. 
br
p Pizzaiolo offers an exciting opportunity for individuals to grow professionally and invest in themselves, provided their passion and values are in line with those of the Pizzaiolo family. We are committed to, and passionate about, providing our customers with the highest quality pizza and service, and will not sacrifice either for price. 
br
p We are currently expanding our license opportunities within the GTA. Are you are a motivated and friendly individual with a passion for pizza and for people? Do you think you have the skills, commitment level, dedication, work ethic, and character to become a Pizzaiolo franchisee? Please note the following:
br
ul
	li Pizzaiolo franchisees must have at least $80,000 unencumbered working capital
